# Possession-2

<p>In Unreal Engine 5, possession refers to the process of assigning a player controller to control a specific pawn or character in the game world. When a player controller possesses a pawn, it gains control over the pawn's actions and behaviors, allowing the player to interact with the game as that character.</p>
<p>Here's an explanation of how possession works in Unreal Engine 5:</p>
<p>1. Player Controller: A player controller is a blueprint or C++ class that represents a player's input and control within the game. It handles input events, manages camera control, and interfaces between the player and the game world.</p>
<p>2. Pawn or Character: In Unreal Engine 5, a pawn or character is an entity that represents a controllable object in the game. Pawns can include characters, vehicles, or any other interactive object that can be possessed by a player controller.</p>
<p>3. Possession Process: The possession process involves linking a player controller with a pawn or character. When a player controller possesses a pawn, it gains control over that pawn's input and behavior. The player can then control the movement, actions, and interactions of the pawn as defined by the pawn's logic and input handling.</p>
<p>4. Possessing a Pawn: To possess a pawn in Unreal Engine 5, you typically use the "Possess" function provided by the player controller. This function takes the pawn as an input parameter and establishes the possession link between the player controller and the pawn. The player controller is then considered the controller for that specific pawn.</p>
<p>5. Possession Events: Unreal Engine 5 provides events that are triggered during the possession process, allowing you to respond to and handle specific actions. For example, the "Possessed" event is fired when a player controller successfully possesses a pawn. You can use these events to initialize the pawn's state, set up initial behaviors, or perform any other necessary setup.</p>
<p>6. Changing Possession: Players can switch their controlled pawn during gameplay. To change the possession from one pawn to another, the player controller can use the "UnPossess" function to release the current pawn and then call the "Possess" function with the new pawn as the input parameter.</p>
<p>7. AI Possession: In addition to player controllers, Unreal Engine 5 also allows for AI-controlled pawns to be possessed. AI controllers can possess pawns to control their actions and behavior, enabling non-player characters to interact with the game world.</p>
<p>Possession in Unreal Engine 5 is a crucial mechanism that enables players and AI to control pawns or characters within the game. By establishing the possession link between a player controller and a pawn, you provide a means for player input to directly influence the behavior and actions of the pawn, enhancing interactivity and gameplay.</p>
