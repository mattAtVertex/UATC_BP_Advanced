# Creating Player Controllers & Classes

<p>Creating Player Controllers &amp; Classes</p>
<p>In Unreal Engine 5, creating player controllers and classes allows you to define the behavior and interactions of players within your game. Player controllers handle input, manage the player's camera, and provide functionality for controlling the character or pawn in the game world.</p>
<p>To create a player controller in Unreal Engine 5, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the Unreal Engine Editor and create a new project or open an existing project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Content Browser, navigate to the folder where you want to store your player controller blueprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click in the folder and select "Create Basic Asset" or "Create Blueprint Class" (depending on your preference).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the "Class" selection window, search for "PlayerController" or browse the "All Classes" tab to find it. Select the "PlayerController" class and click "Create" to generate the blueprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the blueprint is created, you can open it by double-clicking on it in the Content Browser. The blueprint editor will open, allowing you to define the behavior of the player controller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the player controller blueprint, you can customize various aspects such as input handling, camera management, and character/pawn control. For example, you can add input events to respond to player actions like moving, jumping, or interacting with objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To assign the player controller to a specific player, you can do so in the game mode blueprint or through level scripting. The player controller is responsible for managing the input and controlling the character or pawn associated with it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating player classes in Unreal Engine 5 involves creating blueprints for specific characters or pawns that players control in the game. These blueprints define the properties, behavior, and interactions of the player's character.</p>
<p>To create a player class blueprint:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Content Browser, navigate to the folder where you want to store your player class blueprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click in the folder and select "Create Basic Asset" or "Create Blueprint Class."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the "Class" selection window, choose the desired parent class for your player class. This could be a character class, pawn class, or a custom class inherited from them. Select the appropriate parent class and click "Create" to generate the blueprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the blueprint is created, you can open it by double-clicking on it in the Content Browser. The blueprint editor will open, allowing you to define the properties and behavior of the player's character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the player class blueprint, you can customize various aspects such as movement, animations, abilities, and interactions with the game world. You can add components, define variables, and implement event graphs to handle gameplay logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To use the player class blueprint in the game, you can spawn instances of it in the level or assign it to a player controller through game mode blueprint or level scripting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Player controllers and player classes work together to provide the foundation for player interaction in your Unreal Engine 5 game. The player controller manages input and high-level control, while the player class blueprint defines the specific behavior and characteristics of the player's character or pawn.</p>
